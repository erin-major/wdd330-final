1. Anime Facts

- I can get a list of all available animes - I should do this and store it maybe?
- I can get a list of all facts for a specific anime - maybe store that as a length?
- I can get an individual fact for an anime. This is what I want to display. I also want to display the anime name and potentially a picture?

2. Anime DB

- Can take in a search term
- Can take in genres
- Can take in both if wanted
- I can set a page size
- No auth is needed

3. AniDB

- I must register my client
- I set up my client for my project
- I have the client, clientver, and protover for each request
- I get a lot of data back, so I'll need to parse through that and pick what I want
- There is a random request API. That could be really cool to use
- There is a random similar API. I love that!
