            <h2>What is anime?</h2>
            <p class="long">Anime is animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers
                specifically to animation produced in Japan. However, anime, in Japan and in Japanese, describes all
                animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese
                animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that
                may be labelled as anime. <br><br>The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A
                characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in
                the following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through
                television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works,
                anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified
                into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences. <br><br>Anime is a diverse medium with
                distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. Predominantly
                hand-drawn, even into the modern day, anime combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and
                other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime
                production generally focuses less on movement and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera
                effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. Diverse art styles are used, and character
                proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and
                emotive eyes. <br><br>The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies...Since the 1980s,
                the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled
                programming, and since the 2010s due to the rise of streaming services and a widening demographic
                embrace of anime culture, both within Japan and worldwide. As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for
                60% of the world's animated television shows. By 2022, anime had become one of the fastest-growing
                genres of content globally. The medium is currently characterised by increased globalisation, expansive
                cross-cultural collaboration, and significant brand integration, as Japanese-produced animation
                continues to influence and shape media and popular culture on a global scale. (“Anime,” n.d.)</p>
